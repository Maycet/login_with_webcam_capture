# login_with_webcam_capture
Academic prototype for a login app with camera authentication.


The hackathon.pyw file is the main script to execute the aplication. I know that there is an error compiling the OpenCV classes for the camera visualization on the show_frame method, and I hope to solve this as soon as possible (any collaboration is welcome).

The data.json file is used as test database for the registered users.
